# Heart Disease Prediction Model

## Overview
This project involves building an AI Model to predict heart disease based on various medical attributes.The model leverages a dataset containing patient information such as Age, sex,cholesterol levels and more in order to determine the likehood of heart disease.

## Project Structure

- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing the following features:
Age: Age of the patient
Sex: Gender of the patient
ChestPainType: Type of chest pain experienced
RestingBP: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
RestingECG: Resting electrocardiographic results
MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved
ExerciseAngina: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
ST_Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
HeartDisease: Target variable (1 = heart disease; 0 = no heart disease)
